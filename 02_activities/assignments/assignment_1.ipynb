    "+ Was it necessary to convert to pandas to calculate the moving average return?\n",
    " Yes, in this case, switching to Pandas was helpful because, although Dask can perform rolling operations, Pandas often handles them more smoothly on smaller datasets. Using Dask for small data might actually introduce extra processing without real benefits, as Dask is optimized for larger-scale data.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Would it have been better to do it in Dask? Why?\n",
    "For large datasets, Dask would likely be the better choice for calculating the rolling average. It’s designed to work efficiently with bigger data by managing memory better, breaking data into chunks, and only computing when necessary. This way, Dask can handle data sizes that might otherwise overwhelm Pandas.\n",
